# Pet Adoption

Team BAM: Lillian Bolfer, Andrew Michael Machata, Robbie Phillips

This project will draw upon and extend an existing data science project posted on Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data

Using the same dataset, our team plans to provide an API and server (via Flask or Heroku) 
which will allow pet adoption data to be retieved from an SQLlite file, be sorted by pet 
characteristics (i.e. breed, color), and plot the results on a map of Malaysia.

In order to do this, we will need to extract the postcode and utilize a geocode API to
retrieve the coordinates to plot on a mapbox map using Leaflet. 
Our API will also provide the use of a dropdown list to sort the data by at least three
criteria and provide a simple plot of the search results using CanvasJS.

This sets of interactive visualizations will tell a story about Pet Adoption in Malaysia, 
supported by a 10 minute presentation.
